As shown above, we performed a query and set its return to a variable we called
`promise`. Of course we could have called the variable anything, but we called
it that for clarity because that thing it returned was a [*Promise*][Promises].

#### Overview
We don't have space here for a whole primer on *Promises* generally, but in brief
they are a way clean up the callback stack and provide a way for programs to
pass the flow off as it sees fit rather than trying to jam it all into a single
callback function. It offers an inversion of control so the code requesting the
asyncronous operation need not relinquish it.

#### In Programming
In more concrete terms, a *Promise* is an object that has callbacks which will
be called when the asynchronous action finishes.

This means that a program can ask for something that will take time (such as
going off into the intarwebs to hit DynamoDB and return a result) and from that
request receive in return a *Promise* has callbacks which will be called when
things are ready.

#### Real world example
An even more concrete and real world example is that a *Promise* is like one of
those flashy pagers that some restaurants will give you when they have a long
wait.

You no longer have to stand and wait in a line, you can take that pager, go do
something else, and eventually the pager will flash and vibrate you to alert you
that your table is ready.

If you want to learn more about *Promises* and async JavaScript programming
generally I strongly recommend the book [Async JavaScript: Build More Responsive Apps with Less Code][Amazon]

It does a fantastic job of explaining a lot of async JavaScript concepts
and covers *Promises* in Chapter 3.

#### Code!

Enough of the Jibber Jabber though, let's see an example:

{% highlight js %}
// Get a promise back from the query command
var promise = users.find('victorquinn');

// Tell the promise what we want to do when it gets data back from DynamoDB
promise.then(function(user) {
    // Not doing much useful here, but you get the point, not we have the
    // user object so we can act on it.
    console.log(user.first);
});
{% endhighlight %}

Above we just told the *Promise* what to do when it got data back immediately
but we could have passed that promise off to some other method and it could
have added that.

We also could have done other neat things like chaining, error handling, and
more, but that's outside the scope of this brief intro to **Dynasty**.

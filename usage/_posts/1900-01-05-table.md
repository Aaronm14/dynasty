Meanwhile, back at the ranch...

So assuming you've created a table in DynamoDB (either programmatically with
Dynasty or manually in the AWS console) we can **get** an object representing
that *Table* to put items into that table, get items from that table, and
perform any other operations on that table.

So let's say we have a DynamoDB table already created called UserData and we
want to retrieve an item from it.

{% highlight js %}
var dynasty = require('Dynasty')(credentials),
    // Retrieve an instance of the UserData Table
    users = dynasty.get('UserData');
{% endhighlight %}

Now we can query it:

{% highlight js %}
// This will look in the UserData table, returning the item with a Hash key that
// matches 'victorquinn'
var promise = users.find('victorquinn');
{% endhighlight %}

Note, I've chosen to use a Mongo-style syntax here, rather than the DynamoDB
names. This is because:

1. I find it more natural
2. Other developers coming to Dynamo will probably find it more natural
3. If moving to/from DynamoDB this should ease the transition quite a bit.

Also note, we're not passing it a callback. We can, but we don't need to because
we've got promise support baked in! We do also accept a callback function as an
optional argument though!

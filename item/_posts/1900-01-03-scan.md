Scans and returns all items in a table as an array of objects.

You can optionally pass in the LastEvaluatedKey from a previously executed scan
operation as the ExclusiveStartKey to implement paginated scans (when you have
more than 1 MB of date and can't get it all in one go).

{% highlight js %}
var promise = lands.scan();

promise.then(function(allLands) {
    // Iterate through allLands here and do stuff with it.
});
{% endhighlight %}
